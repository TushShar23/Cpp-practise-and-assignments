```
This repository contains C++ codes,assignments that i have completed or will be completing throughout my C++ learning journey
```

#### HOW TO COMPILE CODE

* First you have to download a compiler ( mingw - > g++ recommended)
* Add the path of the compiler into the environment variables path.WHY ? In simple words when you add the the path into environment variables then OS register that path into its list.OS knows where compiler files are now.At the time of compilation when you type the command OS searches for the folder then execute the compiler files. If you will not add then OS will not recognise it.
* After doing all this open your terminal add type

  ```
  g++ --version

  OUTPUT : 
  g++ (GCC) 13.4.0

  **** This output may vary coz i am using cygwin terminal ***
  ```

  Now open your C++ folder where you have files with the extension .cpp
* RUN   COMMAND

  ```
  - g++ filename.cpp -o filename 
  OR 
  - g++ filename.cpp  (then next command)
  ./a.exe
  ```
